(note: discord will not work if you are inside the building due to the actual wifi, use it *outside* of the building :D)

Now that this issue isn't too important anymore, I thought I'd tell you how this works.

In short, most extensions are NOT loaded at runtime due to the extensions not being synced (because you aren't logged in). Therefore, any extension-based blocker (such as Relay or GoGuardian) are disabled, leading to this special kind of mishap. This only happened due to Microsoft's tight integration with GitHub, which by default, is enabled. Due to it being enabled however, clicking the "Sign in with GitHub" button, then clicking the GitHub logo, would result in you being led to the main github page.

By having access to the main page, you also had access to the search bar, which allowed you to search for Repos like this one.
